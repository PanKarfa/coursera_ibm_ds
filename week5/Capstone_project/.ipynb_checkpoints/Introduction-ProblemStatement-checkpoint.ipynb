    "   In every major city criminal activity in some of its forms takes place. London with a population of approximately 8.96 million people, is by far the largest city in the United Kingdom and its respective capital.     Firstly in this report we will try to visualise the boroughs of London and their respective crimes. Secondly we will leverage the power of the Foursquare database to see what types of venues are within these areas with the highest or lowest criminal activity. Finally we would try to find a suitable place to live/move within the city by comparing the house prices and taking into consideration the criminal data nand venues. \n",
    "    This research can be extremely useful for people trying to move to London for employment in order to pick safe locations, buy houses within  a borough with less criminal activity and finally as a reference of which areas are safer or dangerous than others "
